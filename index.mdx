title: "About Codewolf AI"
description: |
  Codewolf is a system of autonomous AI agents that run day-to-day production engineering work directly from Slack. As teams ship continuously, production work often still depends on humans reacting to alerts, digging through dashboards, and coordinating fixes by hand. Codewolf acts as an always-on production teammate that removes this operational burden.

  The agents continuously observe your systems, maintain deep operational context, and take action when needed: investigating incidents, applying fixes through pull requests and configuration changes, detecting issues early, and surfacing clear reports. Codewolf doesn't replace engineers. It reduces operational noise, allowing humans to focus on design, architecture, and building products while production work progresses automatically with full visibility and control.

## Key features

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Investigate">
Tag <span style={{color: '#07C983'}}>@Codewolf</span> in Slack when issues strike. AI agents analyze deployments, correlate logs across services, trace requests, and identify root causes. From alert to diagnosis in minutes.

**Slack mentions:**
- <span style={{color: '#07C983'}}>@Codewolf</span> payment API is throwing 500 errors, customers can't checkout
- <span style={{color: '#07C983'}}>@Codewolf</span> investigate this PagerDuty alert - database latency spiking
- <span style={{color: '#07C983'}}>@Codewolf</span> trace this request ID through our services

**Triggers:**
- Alert: High error rate detected in checkout service
- Webhook: Customer support ticket for checkout failures
- Incident channel created: Site down - payment service unreachable
</Tab>

<Tab title="Fix">
AI agents don't just find problems, they fix them. With full production context and live telemetry, agents generate robust PRs with code patches and configuration changes that resolve issues fast and correctly.

**Slack mentions:**
- <span style={{color: '#07C983'}}>@Codewolf</span> create a PR to fix the connection pool exhaustion
- <span style={{color: '#07C983'}}>@Codewolf</span> fix the memory leak in auth service

**Triggers:**
- Post-investigation: Automatically generate PR with fix
- Alert resolution: Apply configuration change to resolve issue
</Tab>

<Tab title="Prevent">
Catch issues before they reach production. AI agents review PRs for risks, run post-deployment checks, detect anomalies in metrics, and flag suspicious patterns. Stop problems before they become incidents.

**Slack mentions:**
- <span style={{color: '#07C983'}}>@Codewolf</span> review this PR for production risks

**Triggers:**
- GitHub PR opened: Warning - PR #412 introduces potential memory leak
- GitHub deployment: Analyze errors after deploy #1234
- Post-deployment: Detected N+1 query issue in staging

**Schedules:**
- Daily 9am report: 3 services missing error handlers, 2 deprecated APIs in use
</Tab>

<Tab title="Optimize">
Continuously improve your infrastructure. AI agents analyze costs, identify resource waste, recommend performance improvements, and track efficiency trends. Get daily insights without manual analysis.

**Slack mentions:**
- <span style={{color: '#07C983'}}>@Codewolf</span> analyze our infrastructure costs and find savings

**Triggers:**
- Cost spike detected: Investigate unusual AWS spending increase

**Schedules:**
- Weekly Monday report: Reduce AWS costs by 23% by rightsizing 12 EC2 instances
- Daily 9am report: Query optimization opportunities in payment service
</Tab>

<Tab title="Understand">
Codewolf AI agents understand your entire system. Not just your codebase, but production behavior, infrastructure, service dependencies, deployment patterns, and system relationships. This deep context enables smarter investigations, better fixes, and proactive prevention.

**Slack mentions:**
- <span style={{color: '#07C983'}}>@Codewolf</span> explain how the payment service connects to Stripe
- <span style={{color: '#07C983'}}>@Codewolf</span> what services depend on the auth API
- <span style={{color: '#07C983'}}>@Codewolf</span> show me similar incidents we've had with database connections

**Codebase & Architecture:**
- Code structure, patterns, and architectural decisions
- Monorepo organization and cross-service dependencies
- Shared libraries and common utilities

**Production & Runtime:**
- Production behavior and runtime characteristics
- Performance patterns and resource usage
- Error rates and failure modes

**Infrastructure & Topology:**
- Service dependencies and data flow relationships
- Deployment patterns and infrastructure topology
- Network topology and API contracts

**Knowledge & History:**
- Historical incidents and resolution strategies
- Team knowledge from Slack conversations
- Documentation and runbooks

## How Codewolf agents work

Codewolf connects to your systems and continuously learns, then deploys specialized AI agents to handle engineering tasks autonomously.

<Steps>
<Step title="Generate context and update">
  Continuously evaluate and update agent context from your codebase, infrastructure, telemetry, and historical data. Context stays fresh as your systems evolve.
</Step>

<Step title="Triggers">
  Process events from multiple sources - Slack mentions, alerts, cron jobs, GitHub events, and webhooks. Each trigger type is handled with appropriate priority and routing.
</Step>

<Step title="Coordinator and worker agents on demand">
  Spin up worker agents dynamically based on task complexity. The coordinator delegates work across multiple specialized agents running in parallel.
</Step>

<Step title="Integrations tailored with right agent skills">
  Each integration is configured with specific agent skills and capabilities. Rate limit handling ensures reliable operation across all connected tools without hitting API limits.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Architecture

Codewolf maintains continuously updated production context and orchestrates AI agents based on real-time triggers and system state. It pulls real-time data from code, infrastructure, and telemetry (logs, traces, metrics), and responds to events from Slack, alerts, cron jobs, GitHub, and webhooks. A central coordinator dynamically manages an agent pool to handle concurrent production tasks safely. Integrations are skill-aware with built-in rate limiting and retries, while agents evaluate their actions and outcomes, feeding results back into context to refine future decisions and integration behavior as systems evolve.
