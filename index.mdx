## What is Codewolf?

Codewolf provides AI agents that work directly in Slack to handle production engineering tasks. Tag <span style={{color: '#07C983'}}>@Codewolf</span> and agents investigate incidents, optimize costs, and help you ship faster with production context.

## Key features

<CardGroup cols={2}>

<Card title="Investigate">
  Respond to incidents from alerts, customer tickets, and production issues. Get root causes with evidence.
</Card>

<Card title="Fix">
  Receive automated fixes as pull requests, code snippets, and remediation steps after investigation or optimization.
</Card>

<Card title="Prevent">
  Review PRs for risks before deployment. Get daily reports on potential issues before they impact production.
</Card>

<Card title="Optimize">
  Receive scheduled reports on system performance and cost savings. Implement optimizations continuously and automatically.
</Card>

## How Codewolf agents work

Codewolf ingests events from alerts, @mentions, schedules, and webhooks, then generates context for AI agents using your integrations and event metadata.

### Investigate and fix
When issues strike, tag <span style={{color: '#07C983'}}>@Codewolf</span> in Slack. A fleet of AI agents analyzes deployments, correlates logs, triages severity, and delivers fixes with PRs. From investigation to resolution in minutes.

### Act on events
AI agents monitor continuously and act immediately on events. Review PRs for risks, run post-deployment checks, detect anomalies, catch bugs early, flag potential issues - stopping problems before they bite.

### Run on schedules
Set it and forget it. Daily incident summaries at 9am, weekly cost reports, recurring deployment reviews, automated ticket creation - AI agents work while you sleep, so you're always informed without lifting a finger.

### Agent architecture

**Agent Sandbox Environment includes:**
- Isolated compute resources
- Isolated file storage
- Isolated database

## Security

Every customer gets their own isolated Agent Sandbox Environment with:

**Isolated infrastructure:**
- Dedicated compute resources per customer
- Isolated file storage - your data never touches other customers
- Isolated database - complete data separation

**Enterprise security:**
- AES-256 encryption in transit and at rest
- SOC 2 Type II certified
- SSO & SAML support
- Role-based access control

Your data is never shared with other customers or used for model training.
