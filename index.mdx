## What is Codewolf?

Codewolf provides AI agents that work directly in Slack to handle production engineering tasks. Tag <span style={{color: '#07C983'}}>@Codewolf</span> and agents investigate incidents, optimize costs, and help you ship faster with production context.

## Key features

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Investigate" defaultOpen>
  Respond to incidents from alerts, customer tickets, and production issues. Get root causes with evidence.

  **Examples:**
  - "@Codewolf payment API is throwing 500 errors"
  - "Investigate spike in database latency from PagerDuty alert"
  - "Customer reports checkout failures, find the cause"
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Fix">
  Receive automated fixes as pull requests, code snippets, and remediation steps after investigation or optimization.

  **Examples:**
  - Pull request with connection pool size increase to fix database timeouts
  - Code snippet to add missing error handling for API calls
  - Step-by-step remediation plan for security vulnerability
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Prevent">
  Review PRs for risks before deployment. Get daily reports on potential issues before they impact production.

  **Examples:**
  - "PR #412 introduces a potential memory leak in auth service"
  - Daily 9am report: "3 services have missing error handlers"
  - "Deployment to staging detected N+1 query issue"
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Optimize">
  Receive scheduled reports on system performance and cost savings. Implement optimizations continuously and automatically.

  **Examples:**
  - Weekly report: "Reduce AWS costs by 23% by rightsizing EC2 instances"
  - "Detected unused Redis cache, automatic cleanup saved $450/month"
  - "Database query optimization reduced latency by 40%"
</Accordion>

## How Codewolf agents work

Codewolf connects to your production systems, continuously learns from your code, infrastructure, and operations, then deploys specialized AI agents to handle engineering tasks autonomously.

<Steps>
<Step title="Generate context and update">
  Continuously evaluate and update agent context from your codebase, infrastructure, telemetry, and historical data. Context stays fresh as your systems evolve.
</Step>

<Step title="Triggers">
  Process events from multiple sources - Slack mentions, alerts, cron jobs, GitHub events, and webhooks. Each trigger type is handled with appropriate priority and routing.
</Step>

<Step title="Coordinator and worker agents on demand">
  Spin up worker agents dynamically based on task complexity. The coordinator delegates work across multiple specialized agents running in parallel.
</Step>

<Step title="Integrations tailored with right agent skills">
  Each integration is configured with specific agent skills and capabilities. Rate limit handling ensures reliable operation across all connected tools without hitting API limits.
</Step>

## Security

Every customer gets their own isolated Private Agent Sandbox with:

**Isolated infrastructure:**
- Dedicated compute resources per customer
- Isolated file storage - your data never touches other customers
- Isolated database - complete data separation

**Enterprise security:**
- AES-256 encryption in transit and at rest
- SOC 2 Type II certified
- SSO & SAML support
- Role-based access control

Your data is never shared with other customers or used for model training.
