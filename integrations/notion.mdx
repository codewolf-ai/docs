## Overview

Integrate CodeWolf with Notion to automatically sync code documentation, insights, and reports to your team's workspace.

## Prerequisites

- Notion workspace (admin access recommended)
- CodeWolf account

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step title="Create Notion integration">
  Go to [Notion Integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations) and create a new internal integration.

  Give it a name (e.g., "CodeWolf") and select the workspace to connect.
</Step>

<Step title="Copy integration token">
  After creating the integration, copy the **Internal Integration Token**.

  <Warning>
  Keep this token secure. It provides access to your Notion workspace.

</Step>

<Step title="Share pages with integration">
  In Notion, open the pages or databases you want CodeWolf to access.

  Click **Share** and invite your CodeWolf integration.
</Step>

<Step title="Connect to CodeWolf">
  In [CodeWolf dashboard](https://app.codewolf.ai), navigate to **Integrations > Notion**.

  Paste your integration token and select which content to sync.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Integration can't access pages">
  Make sure you've shared the specific pages or databases with your CodeWolf integration. Click **Share** on each page and add the integration.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Sync not working">
  - Verify your integration token is valid
  - Check that the integration hasn't been revoked
  - Ensure you have proper permissions in Notion
  - Review sync settings in CodeWolf dashboard
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Duplicate pages being created">
  CodeWolf uses page IDs to track synced content. If pages are deleted manually in Notion, CodeWolf may recreate them. Use the archive feature instead.
