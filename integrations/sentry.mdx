## Overview

Integrate CodeWolf with Sentry to correlate code quality insights with error tracking and performance monitoring.

## Prerequisites

- Active Sentry account
- Sentry project created
- CodeWolf account

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step title="Get Sentry DSN">
  In your Sentry project, go to **Settings > Projects > [Your Project] > Client Keys (DSN)**.

  Copy the DSN URL for use in CodeWolf.

<Step title="Connect to CodeWolf">
  Navigate to [CodeWolf dashboard](https://app.codewolf.ai) > **Integrations > Sentry**.

  Paste your Sentry DSN and click **Connect**.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure error tracking">
  Enable bidirectional sync between CodeWolf and Sentry:
  - Link Sentry errors to code changes
  - Correlate deployments with error spikes
  - Track error resolution progress
</Step>
</Steps>

## Features

### Error correlation
Automatically link Sentry errors to:
- Recent code commits
- Pull requests
- Deployment events
- Code authors

### Performance insights
Combine Sentry performance data with CodeWolf analysis:
- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Track transaction performance
- Monitor database query efficiency

### Deployment tracking
CodeWolf automatically notifies Sentry of deployments for better release tracking.
