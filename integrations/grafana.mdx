## Overview

Connect CodeWolf to Grafana to create custom dashboards and visualizations for your code quality, performance, and security metrics.

## Prerequisites

- Grafana instance (8.0+)
- Admin access to Grafana
- CodeWolf account and API key

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step title="Install CodeWolf data source plugin">
  In Grafana, navigate to **Configuration > Data sources > Add data source**.

  Search for "CodeWolf" and click **Install**.

  <Note>
  If the plugin isn't available in the marketplace, you can install it manually from the [CodeWolf GitHub repository](https://github.com/codewolf-ai/grafana-datasource).
  </Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure data source">
  After installation, configure the CodeWolf data source:

  - **Name**: CodeWolf
  - **URL**: `https://api.codewolf.ai`
  - **API Key**: Your CodeWolf API key from the dashboard

  Click **Save & Test** to verify the connection.
</Step>

<Step title="Import dashboards">
  Import pre-built CodeWolf dashboards:

  Go to **Dashboards > Import** and use these dashboard IDs:
  - **15001**: Code Quality Overview
  - **15002**: Security Metrics
  - **15003**: Performance Monitoring
  - **15004**: Deployment Tracking
</Step>
</Steps>

## Available metrics

Query these CodeWolf metrics in Grafana:

### Code quality
- `codewolf_quality_score`: Overall code quality score (0-100)
- `codewolf_complexity`: Cyclomatic complexity
- `codewolf_duplication`: Code duplication percentage
- `codewolf_coverage`: Test coverage percentage

### Security
- `codewolf_vulnerabilities_total`: Total security vulnerabilities
- `codewolf_vulnerabilities_by_severity`: Vulnerabilities grouped by severity
- `codewolf_security_score`: Security posture score

### Performance
- `codewolf_build_duration`: Build time in seconds
- `codewolf_test_duration`: Test execution time
- `codewolf_deployment_frequency`: Deployments per day

### Activity
- `codewolf_commits_total`: Total commits
- `codewolf_pull_requests`: Pull request count
- `codewolf_contributors`: Active contributors

## Dashboard examples

### Code quality dashboard

<CodeGroup>
```json Query example
{
  "datasource": "CodeWolf",
  "metric": "codewolf_quality_score",
  "timeRange": "7d",
  "aggregation": "avg",
  "groupBy": ["repository"]
}
```
</CodeGroup>

Create panels for:
- Quality score trend over time
- Repository comparison
- Top issues by category
- Coverage vs. complexity scatter plot

### Security dashboard

Monitor security metrics:
- Vulnerability severity breakdown (pie chart)
- New vulnerabilities over time (time series)
- Mean time to remediation (stat panel)
- Security score by project (bar chart)

### Performance dashboard

Track development velocity:
- Build duration trend
- Test execution time
- Deployment frequency
- CI/CD pipeline success rate

## Query editor

Use the CodeWolf query editor in Grafana:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Metrics">
  Select from available metrics, apply filters, and choose aggregation methods.

  ```
  Metric: codewolf_quality_score
  Filter: repository = "main-app"
  Aggregation: avg
  Group by: branch
  ```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Logs">
  Query CodeWolf logs and events:

  ```
  Type: security_scan
  Severity: high, critical
  Time range: Last 24h
  ```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Alerts">
  Query alert history and status:

  ```
  Status: firing
  Category: performance
  Repository: *
  ```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Alerting

Create Grafana alerts based on CodeWolf metrics:

<Steps>
<Step title="Define alert rule">
  ```
  IF avg(codewolf_quality_score) < 70
  FOR 1h
  LABELS severity=warning
  ```
</Step>

<Step title="Configure notification channel">
  Send alerts to Slack, email, PagerDuty, or other channels.
</Step>

<Step title="Set alert message">
  ```
  Code quality has dropped below 70 for {{ $labels.repository }}
  Current value: {{ $value }}
  ```
</Step>
</Steps>

## Variables

Use dashboard variables for dynamic filtering:

- `$repository`: Filter by repository
- `$branch`: Filter by branch
- `$environment`: Filter by environment
- `$time_range`: Dynamic time range selection

## Annotations

Display CodeWolf events as Grafana annotations:

- Deployment markers
- Release tags
- Security scan completions
- Critical alerts

Enable annotations in dashboard settings:

```json
{
  "datasource": "CodeWolf",
  "type": "events",
  "tags": ["deployment", "release"]
}
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Data source connection failed">
  - Verify your API key is correct and active
  - Check that Grafana can reach `https://api.codewolf.ai`
  - Ensure firewall rules allow outbound HTTPS traffic
  - Confirm your CodeWolf account has API access enabled
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="No data in panels">
  - Check the time range includes data points
  - Verify metric names are spelled correctly
  - Ensure filters aren't excluding all data
  - Confirm your account has access to the selected repositories
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Slow query performance">
  - Reduce the time range for queries
  - Use aggregation to limit data points
  - Enable query caching in data source settings
  - Consider downsampling high-frequency metrics
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
