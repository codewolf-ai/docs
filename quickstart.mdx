Codewolf is currently in limited early access. We're onboarding teams in small batches and working closely with early users to incorporate feedback. Setup is guided and typically takes only a few minutes.

<Step title="Guided onboarding">
  A member of the Codewolf team will reach out to help you get set up. We'll start by connecting Slack and walking through your first automation so agents can begin working immediately.
