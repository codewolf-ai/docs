## Overview

Codewolf Automations allow you to create intelligent, event-driven workflows that respond to code changes, quality metrics, and deployment events automatically.

## What are automations?

Automations are rules that trigger actions when specific conditions are met. They help you:

- Enforce code quality standards automatically
- Notify teams of critical issues instantly
- Auto-assign reviewers based on code changes
- Create tickets for technical debt
- Update documentation automatically
- Trigger deployments based on quality gates

## Creating automations

<Steps>
<Step title="Define the trigger">
  Choose what event should start the automation.

  ```yaml
  trigger:
    event: pull_request.opened
    conditions:
      - branch: main
      - files_changed: "src/**"
  ```
</Step>

<Step title="Set conditions">
  Specify when the automation should run.

  ```yaml
  conditions:
    - quality_score: < 80
    - test_coverage: < 90
    - security_issues: > 0
  ```
</Step>

<Step title="Configure actions">
  Define what should happen when conditions are met.

  ```yaml
  actions:
    - type: notify
      channel: slack
      message: "Quality gate failed for PR"

    - type: block_merge
      reason: "Quality score below threshold"
  ```
</Step>
</Steps>

## Automation types

### Quality gates

Enforce quality standards before merging:

<CodeGroup>
```yaml Quality gate automation
automations:
  - name: enforce-quality-standards
    trigger:
      event: pull_request.opened

    conditions:
      quality_score: ">= 80"
      test_coverage: ">= 85"
      complexity: "<= 10"

    actions:
      - type: status_check
        status: failed
        message: "Quality standards not met"

      - type: comment
        template: |
          Quality gate failed:
          - Score: {{ quality_score }}
          - Coverage: {{ test_coverage }}%
          - Complexity: {{ complexity }}
```
</CodeGroup>

### Auto-assignment

Assign reviewers based on expertise:

<CodeGroup>
```yaml Auto-assignment automation
automations:
  - name: auto-assign-reviewers
    trigger:
      event: pull_request.opened

    conditions:
      files_changed:
        - pattern: "src/payments/**"
          assign: payments-team

        - pattern: "src/auth/**"
          assign: security-team

        - pattern: "**/*.sql"
          assign: database-team

    actions:
      - type: assign_reviewers
        based_on_files: true
```
</CodeGroup>

### Issue creation

Automatically create issues for technical debt:

<CodeGroup>
```yaml Issue creation automation
automations:
  - name: track-technical-debt
    trigger:
      event: code.scan.completed

    conditions:
      technical_debt_hours: "> 40"
      complexity_increase: "> 20%"

    actions:
      - type: create_issue
        title: "High technical debt detected"
        labels:
          - technical-debt
          - priority-medium
        body: |
          Technical debt has increased significantly:
          - Total hours: {{ technical_debt_hours }}
          - Complexity increase: {{ complexity_increase }}%

          Affected files:
          {% for file in affected_files %}
          - {{ file.path }} ({{ file.debt_hours }}h)
          {% endfor %}
```
</CodeGroup>

### Notifications

Send alerts to the right people:

<CodeGroup>
```yaml Notification automation
automations:
  - name: critical-security-alerts
    trigger:
      event: security.vulnerability.detected

    conditions:
      severity:
        - critical
        - high

    actions:
      - type: notify
        channels:
          - slack: "#security-alerts"
          - email: security@example.com
          - pagerduty: security-oncall

        message: |
          🚨 Critical security vulnerability detected

          Severity: {{ severity }}
          CVE: {{ cve_id }}
          File: {{ file_path }}:{{ line_number }}

          Action required immediately.
```
</CodeGroup>

### Deployment gates

Control when deployments can happen:

<CodeGroup>
```yaml Deployment gate automation
automations:
  - name: production-deployment-gate
    trigger:
      event: deployment.requested
      environment: production

    conditions:
      quality_score: ">= 90"
      security_issues: "== 0"
      test_coverage: ">= 95"
      all_checks_passed: true

    actions:
      - type: approve_deployment
        when: conditions_met

      - type: block_deployment
        when: conditions_not_met
        reason: "Quality gates not passed"

      - type: notify
        channel: slack
        message: |
          Production deployment {{ status }}
          Quality: {{ quality_score }}/100
```
</CodeGroup>

```

### Pattern matching
```yaml
conditions:
  files_changed:
    - "src/**/*.py"
    - "tests/**/*.py"

  branch: "feature/*"

  author: "@backend-team"
```

```yaml
conditions:
  all_of:
    - quality_score: ">= 80"
    - test_coverage: ">= 85"

  any_of:
    - severity: critical
    - affected_users: "> 1000"

automations:
  - name: weekly-quality-report
    trigger:
      schedule: "0 9 * * MON"  # Every Monday at 9am

    actions:
      - type: generate_report
        type: quality
        period: 7d

      - type: notify
        channel: slack
        message: "Weekly quality report available"
```
</CodeGroup>

## Best practices

<Check>
**Design effective automations:**
- Start simple, iterate based on feedback
- Test automations in staging first
- Use clear, descriptive names
- Document automation purpose
- Monitor automation performance
</Check>

<Tip>
**Avoid automation fatigue:**
- Don't over-notify teams
- Use appropriate severity levels
- Batch non-urgent notifications
- Provide actionable information
- Allow users to customize preferences
</Tip>

<Warning>
**Be cautious with:**
- Auto-merging pull requests
- Automatic production deployments
- Blocking all PRs by default
- Excessive notifications
- Complex condition logic
</Warning>

## Monitoring automations

Track automation performance in the dashboard:

- **Execution history**: See when automations ran
- **Success rate**: Track automation reliability
- **Impact metrics**: Measure effectiveness
- **Error logs**: Debug failed automations
